# QueryBox

**QueryBox** is a lightweight database management tool for executing and managing queries.

## Repository layout
```
/ (repo root)
├─ docs/        # documentation (see each folder's README.md)
└─ README.md    # project overview
```

> Note: the project uses `kebab-case` for documentation filenames and keeps the detailed-design folder intentionally minimal to follow YAGNI.
