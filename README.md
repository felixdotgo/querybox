# QueryBox

**QueryBox** is a lightweight database management tool for executing and managing queries.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

2. To run your application in development mode, use the following command:

   ```
   wails3 dev
   ```

   This will start your application and enable hot-reloading for both frontend and backend changes.

3. To build your application for production, use:

   ```
   wails3 build
   ```

   This will create a production-ready executable in the `build` directory.

## Project Structure

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with your project structure:

- `docs/`: Documentation for QueryBox, organized into `basic-design/` and `detailed-design/` folders with their own README.md files.
- `frontend/`: Contains your frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- `main.go`: The entry point of your Go backend
- `app.go`: Define your application structure and methods here
- `wails.json`: Configuration file for your Wails project

## Next Steps

1. Modify the frontend in the `frontend/` directory to create your desired UI.
2. Add backend functionality in `main.go`.
3. Use `wails3 dev` to see your changes in real-time.
4. When ready, build your application with `wails3 build`.
